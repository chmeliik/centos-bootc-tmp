# This container build uses some special features of podman that allow
# a process executing as part of a container build to generate a new container
# image "from scratch".
#
# This container build uses nested containerization, so you must build with e.g.
# podman build --security-opt=label=disable --cap-add=all --device /dev/fuse <...>
#
# # Why are we doing this?
#
# Today this base image build process uses rpm-ostree.  There is a lot of things that
# rpm-ostree does when generating a container image...but important parts include:
#
# - auto-updating labels in the container metadata
# - Generating "chunked" content-addressed reproducible image layers (notice
#   how there are ~60 layers in the generated image)
#
# The latter bit in particular is currently impossible to do from Containerfile.
# A future goal is adding some support for this in a way that can be honored by
# buildah (xref https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/12605)
#
# # Why does this build process require additional privileges?
#
# Because it's generating a base image and uses containerization features itself.
# In the future some of this can be lifted.
